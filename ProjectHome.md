# About #
This is a fork of JADclipse as the theproject on sourceforge seems to be dead and I failed to contact the guys maintaining the project

# What it does #
This plug-in seamlessly integrates a decompiler of your choice [JAD, JD, JODE] in Eclipse.

Normally, when opening a class file the Class File Viewer will show a brief API outline of the class. If you install this plug-in, however, the Class File Viewer will be replaced with the Decopliler Class File Viewer that shows the decompiled source of the class. This task is accomplished by decompiling the corresponding class file in the background using a decompiler of your coice. Normal Java syntax highlighting as well as the Outline View are supported.

_Note:_ Jad (the decompiler executable) must be downloaded separately [here](http://www.varaneckas.com/jad/)
